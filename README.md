# Finding Donors for CharityML
This Project is mainly a comparison between a different algorithms in supervised learning. <br>
In this Notebook I used three techniques which are: Decision Tree, AdaBoost and SVM.<br>

This project contains three files:
- finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file.
- census.csv: The project dataset. 
- visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
